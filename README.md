# MIT MSA Website

This repository contains the source code for the MIT MSA (Muslim Student Association) website.

The website is hosted on msa.mit.edu, which is hosted on MIT's Athena system. As a result, the source files that are hosted on Athena need to be static files (i.e., HTML, CSS, JS, images, etc.).
